            <li>
              <strong>Learning to code:</strong>&nbsp;I enjoy watching videos on
              programming and reading programming books. Some of the programming
              languages I enjoy learning are Java, Python, JavaScript, C++. I am
              looking forward to mastering these languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Playing tennis:</strong>&nbsp; My favorite tennis star is
              Rafael Nadal
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Watching Formula-1:</strong>&nbsp; I have been watching
              formula-1 now for over 30 years. It is definitely my number one
              sport. My favorite formula-1 driver is Lewis Hamilton. It used to
              be a fan of Damon Hill, David Coulthard in the past.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading Russian Classical novels:</strong>&nbsp; I enjoy
              reading books by Dostoyevsky and Tolsltoi. &quot;Crime and
              Punishment&quot; and &quot;War and Peace&quot; are some of my
              favorite books.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Travelling:</strong>&nbsp; I enjoy travelling by air,
              road, train etc. I feel very much at home in airports and train
              stations. Watching TV or working on my computer in long haul
              flights is something I enjoy doing. I always make sure to watch a
              John Wick movie whenever I am in a plane. I also enjoy driving. I
              remember once I flew to London Heathrow and rented a BMW 5-
              <sup>&reg;</sup> and drove all the way to Aberdeen (just for the
              fun of it!!). My favorite car is Audi-A4 <sup>&reg;</sup>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fitness: </strong> &nbsp; I enjoy running, cycling,
              lifting weights. I am happiest when I make fitness part of my
              daily routine.
